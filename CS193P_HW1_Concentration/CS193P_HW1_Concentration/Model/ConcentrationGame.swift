/// This class represents the rules of the card game Concentration, which is a game where a player attempts to find matching pairs of cards on a table of cards. Each card on the table has exactly one matching card also on the table. All cards begin facedown and the palyer is allowed to flip two cards face up each turn. If the two flipped cards match, the player earns 2 points and the cards are removed from the game. However, if they do not match, the player loses 1 point for every time each card has been mismatched previously and the cards are flipped back to face down.
